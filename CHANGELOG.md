### Changed

- **Modernized Command Output** - Artisan commands now use Laravel Prompts instead of `$this->` methods for better UX
- **Config Facade Usage** - Replaced `config()` helper with `Config` facade throughout source code:
  - `src/Http/DynamicHLSPlaylist.php`
  - `src/Http/DynamicDASHManifest.php`
  - `src/Support/ShakaPackager.php`
  - `src/MediaOpener.php`
  - `src/Filesystem/Media.php`
  - Provides better type safety and IDE support
  

### Fixed

- Fixed `Config::string()` to `Config::get()` in `ShakaPackager::create()` to properly handle array configuration
- Corrected force_generic_input configuration implementation to actually respect the config setting

### Documentation

- Enhanced docs/README.md with links to new guides
- Added comprehensive troubleshooting section
- Added queue integration examples and best practices

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-20

### Fixed

- Prevent Shaka Packager "Unknown field in stream descriptor" errors when filenames include smart quotes, commas, parentheses, or start with a dash.
- Use array-based process execution to avoid shell quoting issues with special characters.

### Added

- Descriptor sanitization in `Foxws\\Shaka\\Support\\CommandBuilder`:
  
  - Normalize smart quotes to ASCII
  - Replace commas with hyphens (commas are field separators in Shaka descriptors)
  - Trim surrounding quotes
  - Prefix leading dashes with `./` to avoid option confusion
  
- Unit tests covering descriptor sanitization for leading dashes, smart quotes, commas, and output filenames.
  
- `force_generic_input` config option to automatically create safe generic aliases for input files.
  
  - When enabled, creates a temporary copy/symlink with a generic name (e.g., `input.mp4`).
  - Prevents issues with any special characters in filenames (parentheses, brackets, smart quotes, etc.).
  - Uses symlinks for local disks (fast) and copies for remote disks (compatible).
  - Set `PACKAGER_FORCE_GENERIC_INPUT=true` in `.env` to enable.
  

### Internal

- Switch `Foxws\\Shaka\\Support\\Packager` to pass arguments using `buildArray()`.
- Update `Foxws\\Shaka\\Support\\ShakaPackager::command()` to accept `string|array` and run via `Process::run([$binary, ...$args])`.

  - `setPlaylistUrlResolver()` - Generate URLs for sub-playlists
  - Process and rewrite playlist files with custom URLs
  - Return as HTTP response with correct content type
  - Automatic URL caching for performance

### Encryption

- Browser-compatible HLS encryption using AES-128-CBC
  
  - Use `protection_scheme: 'cbc1'` for browser-compatible encryption
  - Use `.ts` segments (not `.mp4`) for encrypted content
  - Set `clear_lead: 0` to encrypt all segments from the start
  - Default (no protection_scheme) produces SAMPLE-AES which only works on native iOS/tvOS
  
- Comprehensive encryption documentation in README
